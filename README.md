# ðŸ—‚ Project Structure

- **`Data_Preprocess.ipynb`**: Preprocesses raw stock market data (e.g., calculates technical indicators, cleans data, prepares training features).
- **`Forecasting_Models.ipynb`**: Trains forecasting models (such as XGBoost, LSTM, or Prophet) to predict stock market trends or next-day closing prices.
- **`Simulation.ipynb`**: Simulates stock trading based on forecasted prices, testing different trading strategies and evaluating portfolio performance.
- **`Final Agent.ipynb`**: Runs the final trading agent, integrating forecasting, risk management, and decision-making policies to simulate real-world trading scenarios.
